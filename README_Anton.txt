This uses the DecawaveMDEK1001 custom firmware examples repository:
https://github.com/Decawave/dwm1001-examples/tree/master

I modified examples/ss_twr_init/Application/ss_init_main.c

Other node just has to run ss_twr_res as is.

I have notes on how to set Segger up to compile with this.

Pushing this just so I have the code saved somewhere before I try adding this to Beluga.
